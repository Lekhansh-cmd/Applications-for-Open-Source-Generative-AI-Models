# Applications-for-Open-Source-Generative-AI-Models

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore various AI models and deploy applications using Gradio, a web-based interface for machine learning models. The project focuses on three main tasks:

1. Building an AI Tutor using the Dolly 3B model.
2. Text Generation Using the Falcon 7B model.
3. Generation using Stable Diffusion.

## Models Overview
### Dolly 3B Model
Dolly is a state-of-the-art AI model trained for various natural language processing tasks. The Dolly 3B model, specifically used in this project, has been fine-tuned for educational purposes, enabling it to act as an AI Tutor. It can answer questions, provide explanations, and assist learners in understanding various topics.
